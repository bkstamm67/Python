#Homework 2 - Steel Tubes
#10.7.14

#This program calculates volume and surface area of an object, and then get cost of
#manufacturing it.  It does round values, which are noted in the code.  Calculations were seperated out
#from the program for ease.  Also, I attempted to have as few of variables as possible.

#Test Cases - 1st - h=98,r=22,#=13.  When I ran thru it, got vol_individual=149012.02
#vol_total=1937156.296, sa_steel=215638.92, sa_rubber=215.645.42, steel_cost=25876.67
#rubber_cost=8625.82, with a total=34502.49.  When I ran it, the numbers were close
#especially considering the rounding.

#Test Case 2 - h=20,r=5,#=10, vol_individual=1570.796, vol_total=15707.9,
#sa_steel=7853.98, sa_rubber=7068.58, steel_cost=942.48
#rubber_cost=282.24, with a total=1225.22
