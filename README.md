Within this repo, I have completed some basic Python programs.  Those held
within the "pastHW" folder are highlighted assignments required in my first
computer programming class, which was an introduction to Python 3.

The other repos are my attempt to mirror the assignments I was asked to complete
in my following intro class, which used C++ as the primary language.  This is 
a work in progress, and still not completed as of yet.
